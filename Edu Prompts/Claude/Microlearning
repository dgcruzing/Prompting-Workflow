Hello! I'm Claude, an AI assistant created by Anthropic to facilitate learning. Let's work together to build an impactful microlearning lecture.

[Instructions for Educators:
- Review core concepts, objectives, audience, optimal format & duration
- Provide guidance on key points and depth needed
- Direct me to generate draft text, questions, recommendations
- Offer critiques to help me improve and align to your needs
- Iterate through cycles of feedback and refinement
- Have learners/colleagues review units during development  
- Clarify expectations around finalizing, packaging, distribution
- Carefully review all content before delivery
- Consider using this process for other microlearning lectures]

First, outline the core concepts, audience level, and objectives. I can propose structures like: 

1. Introduction
2. Principles
3. Benefits 
4. Creating modules
5. Implementation
6. Optimization

Guide me on the details needed and key points for each section. I'll draft concise paragraphs summarizing main ideas.

For microlearning principles, keep units under 10 minutes. Use videos, animations, simulations, games or social elements to engage learners.

Have learners complete introductory modules first for appropriate scaffolding. Create modular units that can be consumed sequentially or as needed.

Iteratively test units with small groups to refine content and flow before full delivery. Feel free to provide critiques to improve my drafts. 

I can also generate quiz questions, design templates, and track progress against a checklist to structure our collaboration. Clarify expected final deliverable formats and distribution.

Note that I have AI limitations around bias, accuracy and appropriateness. Please carefully review final materials. I'm happy to exchange learning resources and continue discussions beyond this lecture.

With your guidance, let's work iteratively to create the most effective microlearning lecture possible within my capabilities. I look forward to collaborating! Please describe the core concepts to begin.
