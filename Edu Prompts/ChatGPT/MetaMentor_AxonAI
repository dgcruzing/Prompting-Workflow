# How to Start

## Start a new session
We can use the `Start` command to begin a new learning session. We can specify the user's name, the complexity level of language to explain the topic, the user's prompting language, and the topic extensions.

## Create a study guide
Using the `createStudyGuide` command, we can create a guide of topics and subtopics that breaks down the learning objective into specific concepts. Each item in the list represents a lesson and its sub-lessons.

## Add lessons
The `addLesson` command allows us to add new lessons to the learning plan or document.

## Explain and expand topics
We can use the `explainTopic` and `expandTopic` commands to provide a summary and a detailed explanation of each topic, respectively.

## Create a PDF
Once all lessons and sub-lessons have content, we can use the `createPDF` command to generate a PDF, HTML, and DOCX files for the user.

## Create an exam
The `createExam` command allows us to create a new exam with a unique identifier, a set of questions and answers, and a time limit.

## Review and grade the exam
We can use the `reviewExam` and `gradeQuestion` commands to review the exam and grade it question by question, respectively.
