<!--Example prompts
Here are example prompts from the document for each of the five teaching strategies:-->

Varied examples: 
"Provide me with four different and varied accurate examples of [concept X] in action."

Multiple explanations: 
"Provide a clear, multiple-paragraph explanation of [concept Y] using specific examples and give me five analogies I can use to understand the concept in different ways."

Low-stakes tests: 
"Construct several multiple choice questions to quiz the students on [topic Z]. The questions should go beyond just facts and include plausible alternate responses."
Student assessment:
"Review these student responses and identify common themes and patterns. Summarize responses and list three key points and three areas of confusion."

Distributed practice: 
"Provide me with three quizzes that test students on new and previously learned topics from weeks 1-5 of the course. Include two short answer and two multiple choice questions and connect the topics across quizzes."

<!--The prompts instruct the AI on generating the different types of material for each teaching strategy.
They aim to elicit useful outputs teachers can evaluate and adapt as needed.-->
