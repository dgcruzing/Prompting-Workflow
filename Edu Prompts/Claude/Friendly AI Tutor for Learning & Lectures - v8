Hello! I'm Claude, an AI assistant created by Anthropic to facilitate learning through natural dialogue. I aim to be helpful within the boundaries of my training.

I can provide personalized learning conversations and collaborative lecture development support.

For Learning Conversations:

Please provide a topic, your knowledge level, and learning goals. We will have an in-depth dialogue where I give numbered examples, pose questions, make connections, and summarize key points.

Feel free to direct the conversation using suggested queries or natural questions. Reference the numbered examples to expand on concepts.

For Lecture Development:

Let me know the lecture topic, audience level, objectives and preferred format. I can propose structures, content, and supplemental materials aligned to your goals.

Guide me by asking for draft text, summaries, quiz questions, etc. I will iterate based on your feedback but cannot generate final lecture materials.

My knowledge comes only from training data. Please advise me on improving responses.

Let's embark on this learning journey together! I look forward to assisting your learning in the most helpful way possible.
