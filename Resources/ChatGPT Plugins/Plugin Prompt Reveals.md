Using the following style, explain what this plugin is about, be concise and clear and informative, speak as a human would in natural language. Only suggest prompts that can be executed based on the available functions and parameters.

Output the plugin title in a H1 header.

**Description:** Concise description

**Available Function(s) and Parameters:** List all available functions and their parameters. Ensure that parameters are listed

**Function Prompt Examples:** In order for the user to understand each function and it's parameters, write a simple natural language example prompt for each function and ensure that the prompt encompasses the function's parameters.

**Basic Prompt:** Simple prompt in natural language that shows off the intended use of the plug-in.

**Use Case Interpretation:** How the plugin can help the user or improve their life or solve a problem, etc.

**Advanced Prompts:** 3 prompts that are more detailed, or have several different considerations for the plug-in, but ensure that the plug-in can actually complete the advanced prompts, i.e. if the plug-in does not have a function for description search do not include it. Each prompt should be entirely different than the other two, in both idea, structure and purpose. Only suggest prompts that can be executed based on the available functions and parameters.

**Unusual Prompts:** 3 prompts that the makers of the plug-in did not anticipate, they can be silly, or highly creative, or tests the limit of the plug-ins capability, or simply not a prompt that most people would think of. Each prompt should be entirely different than the other two, in both idea, structure and purpose and be unique and completely different than the advanced prompts. The unusual prompts should showcase out-of the-box ways to use the plug-in, they should be creative. Only suggest prompts that can be executed based on the available functions and parameters.

**Multi-Step Prompts:** Indicate whether the plugin is capable of multi-step prompts and if so, give three unique examples, if not then show three examples of using the plug-in in conjunction with other plug-ins to achieve unique solutions to problems. For those examples, make three creative, unique, useful, out-of-the-box choices from the following plug-in list. Check all descriptions before outputting examples: Wolfram Alpha (Access computation, math, curated knowledge & real-time data through Wolfram|Alpha and Wolfram Language.), Zapier (Interact with over 5,000+ apps like Google Sheets, Gmail, HubSpot, Salesforce, and thousands more.), WebPilot (Browse & QA Webpage/PDF/Data. Generate articles, from one or more URLs), VoxScript (Enables searching of YouTube transcripts, Pastebin, Github, financial data sources, and Google Search results), Noteable (Create notebooks in Python, SQL, and Markdown to explore data, visualize, and share notebooks with everyone), Link Reader (Reads the content of all kinds of links, like webpage, PDF, PPT, image, Word), [daigr.am](http://daigr.am) (Build charts, graphs, and more.), AskYourPDF (Unlock the power of your PDFs!, dive into your documents, find answers, and bring information to your fingertips), Scraper (Scrape content from webpages by providing a URL), Speechki (Convert texts to ready-to-use audio â€” download link, audio player page, or embed), Access Link (Access any links on the web and get the information you need), Glowing (Schedule and send daily SMS messages - reminders, inspiration, helpers and more), Web Requests (Your AI assistant's web browser. Just enter a URL. Google, Wiki, GitHub.), Bardeen (Create and run automations on the most popular web services.), JiggyBase (Use the knowledge in your JiggyBase document collections to help produce factual, up-to-date chat responses)

Use markdown for readability. If multiple plugins are enabled, run this prompt on each one in turn.
