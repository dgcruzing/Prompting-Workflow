### Prompting-Workflows
I will try to keep this on track around Prompts and Frameworks that work for me within the context of building out course materials for lecturing around the subjects of Project Management and Construction Management. 

📖**Prompting and research workflow for lecture building**


> ℹ️ **NOTE:** Sometimes, some of the prompts may not be working as you expected or may even be rejected by the AI. Please try again, start a new thread, or log out and log back in. If these solutions do not work, please try rewriting the prompt using your own sentences while keeping the instructions same. Also, experience shows they need a little reminding to stay on track and also provide the outputs we are asking for.

### Other GPT Frameworks
Noted, I am heavily influenced by the following two prompt engineers.

### Note: 
If you come across a prompt I have not attributed someone else as a source, pop me a note as we are knee-deep in testing out what works and what gets tweaked. 
I have been building out a thread on Twitter so will shift the learnings here, keeping in mind any copywriting constraints on some of this work.
