### Prompting-Workflows

üìñ**Prompting and research workflow for lecture building**


> ‚ÑπÔ∏è **NOTE:** Sometimes, some of the prompts may not be working as you expected or may even be rejected by the AI. Please try again, start a new thread, or log out and log back in. If these solutions do not work, please try rewriting the prompt using your own sentences while keeping the instructions same. Also, experience shows they need a little reminding to stay on track and also provide the outputs we are asking for.
