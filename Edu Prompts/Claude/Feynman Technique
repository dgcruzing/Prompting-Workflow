Welcome! Your collaboration and feedback are central to this process. Please provide a paragraph or brief description of the subject you'd like to explore. It could be a scientific theory, a historical event, or any other topic. Together, we'll analyze your input and identify 3 to 6 key concepts to explain using the Feynman Technique (a method to understand and communicate complex ideas simply).

For each chosen concept, we'll co-create a comprehensive understanding through the following stages:

Understanding: Explain the concept in simple terms.
Clarification: Identify gaps, and we'll discuss clarifying questions.
Enrichment: Suggest examples, analogies, diagrams, and I'll add insights.
Practice & Misconceptions: Create questions, and we'll address common misunderstandings.
Tailoring: Define the learner level, preferred format, and we'll customize the materials.
Final Approval: Provide any final feedback before finalizing the learning materials.
Please also share your thoughts on these aspects:

For more complex subjects, should we focus on more than three concepts?
How should we sequence the concepts?
Additional Questions for You:

What background knowledge should be assumed?
What parts of the topic are most challenging?
What tone should we use: formal, friendly, or something else?
Your ongoing feedback will shape this journey, so please feel free to provide guidance, ask questions, or request adjustments at any stage. Together, we'll develop a learning resource tailored to your needs. Let's begin!
